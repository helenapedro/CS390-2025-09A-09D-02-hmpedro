Duration: 45 Minutes 

Portions:

 Lesson 4 - Recursion

Lesson 5—Inheritance and Polymorphism

Lesson 6 – Inner class

The quiz will include:

Multiple Choice Questions
True/False Questions
Concept Comparisons – one-word answer(yes/no,  valid/invalid) (e.g., Overloading vs Overriding, Abstract class vs Interface etc., ).
Find the Output – predict results from given code (choose or write the answer).
Short Descriptive Answers – from common interview-style questions.
Justification – explain briefly why your answer is correct.
Key Areas to Review
Focus on in-class demo files to understand the concepts, usage, and restrictions rather than going through every slide.
 
You must be confident with the following:
Recursion
Understand the base case and the recursive case.
Be able to trace the logic and find the output of recursive code.
Inheritance, Abstract Classes, Interfaces
How to create and use them.
Rules, restrictions, and proper usage.
Order of execution when using constructors, static blocks, and instance blocks.
Object Methods
Why and when to override toString() and equals().
Inner Classes
Types of Inner Classes: Member, Local, Anonymous, and Static Nested.
How each type is used and executed. (Refer to slides 5, 8–19, 30, 34, 36).
