Problem 3 — Browser History (two stacks + current URL)

What I need:
    Two stacks to manage back and forward history, plus a currentUrl.
    Methods:
        visit(String url) - updates the curr URL and manages the history stacks
        back()    - allow the user to navigate back to the previous URL in the history.
        forward() - should allow the user to navigate forward to the next URL in the fw history.
    Behavior should match the sample run
            (messages like “Visited: …”, “Back to: …”, “No history to go back to.”).
